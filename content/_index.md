Hi, I’m Gideon! 👋  

I currently work as a **Data Engineer** in the cybersecurity field, where I design and maintain data pipelines and work with cloud technologies.  

Outside of work, I’m passionate about:  
- **Tech & Coding** – exploring new tools, building side projects, and learning new programming concepts  
- **Fitness & Sports** – running, gym workouts, and playing badminton  
- **Travel & Nature** – discovering new places and enjoying quiet, scenic spots  

This blog is a space where I occasionally write about my projects, personal growth, and reflections on life.
